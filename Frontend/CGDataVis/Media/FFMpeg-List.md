# FFmpeg

- [ffmpeg.wasm #Project#](https://ffmpegwasm.github.io/): ffmpeg.wasm is a pure WebAssembly / JavaScript port of FFmpeg. It enables video & audio record, convert and stream right inside browsers.

- [Learn FFmpeg libav the Hard Way](https://parg.co/UkX): I was looking for a tutorial/book that would teach me how to start to use FFmpeg as a library (a.k.a. libav) and then I found the "How to write a video player in less than 1k lines" tutorial. Unfortunately it was deprecated, so I decided to write this one.

- [2015-How to Write a Video Player in Less Than 1000 Lines](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.html): There is a sample program that comes with ffmpeg called ffplay. It is a simple C program that implements a complete video player using ffmpeg.
