- [Vision-diff #Project#](https://github.com/Meituan-Dianping/vision-diff): Vision-diff is an image comparison algorithm just like the diff utility. It is line-oriented rather than pixel-oriented, as a result, it returns a much more clear differences than the traditional pixel based image comparison algorithm (See the below example).

- [Learn FFmpeg libav the Hard Way](https://parg.co/UkX): I was looking for a tutorial/book that would teach me how to start to use FFmpeg as a library (a.k.a. libav) and then I found the "How to write a video player in less than 1k lines" tutorial. Unfortunately it was deprecated, so I decided to write this one.

- [2015-How to Write a Video Player in Less Than 1000 Lines](http://dranger.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.html): There is a sample program that comes with ffmpeg called ffplay. It is a simple C program that implements a complete video player using ffmpeg.
