- [2018-pcl ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/PointCloudLibrary/pcl)](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl): The Point Cloud Library (PCL) is a standalone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing.

- [2020-CloudCompare ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CloudCompare/CloudCompare)](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare): CloudCompare is a 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) processing software. It was originally designed to perform comparison between two 3D points clouds (such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) or between a point cloud and a triangular mesh. It relies on an octree structure that is highly optimized for this particular use-case. It was also meant to deal with huge point clouds (typically more than 10 million points, and up to 120 million with 2 GB of memory).

- [2020-Point2Mesh ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ranahanocka/Point2Mesh)](https://github.com/ranahanocka/Point2Mesh): Point2Mesh is a technique for reconstructing a surface mesh from an input point cloud. This approach "learns" from a single object, by optimizing the weights of a CNN to deform some initial mesh to shrink-wrap the input point cloud. The argument for going this route is: since the (local) convolutional kernels are optimized globally across the entire shape, this encourages local-scale geometric self-similarity across the reconstructed shape surface.
