- [2020-CloudCompare ![code](https://martrix-usa.oss-accelerate.aliyuncs.com/logo/code.svg) ![star](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/CloudCompare/CloudCompare)](https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare): CloudCompare is a 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) processing software. It was originally designed to perform comparison between two 3D points clouds (such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) or between a point cloud and a triangular mesh. It relies on an octree structure that is highly optimized for this particular use-case. It was also meant to deal with huge point clouds (typically more than 10 million points, and up to 120 million with 2 GB of memory).
