This approach "learns" from a single object, by optimizing the weights of a CNN to deform some initial mesh to shrink-wrap the input point cloud. The argument for going this route is: since the (local) convolutional kernels are optimized globally across the entire shape, this encourages local-scale geometric self-similarity across the reconstructed shape surface.
