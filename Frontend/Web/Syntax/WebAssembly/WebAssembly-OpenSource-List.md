- [AssemblyScript #Project#](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/prototype): AssemblyScript defines a subset of TypeScript that it compiles to WebAssembly.

- [Walt #Project#](https://github.com/ballercat/walt): WAlt is an alternative syntax for WebAssembly text format. It's an experiment for using JavaScript syntax to write to as 'close to the metal' as possible.
