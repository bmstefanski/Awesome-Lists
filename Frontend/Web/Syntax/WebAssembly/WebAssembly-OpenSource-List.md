# WebAssembly OpenSource List

# Showcase

- [2017-ROCKET - A RUST GAME RUNNING ON WASM](https://parg.co/UZJ): I thought it would be interesting to try to adapt my game Rocket to work on the browser through the wasm32-unknown-unknown target.

- [AssemblyScript #Project#](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/prototype): AssemblyScript defines a subset of TypeScript that it compiles to WebAssembly.

- [Walt #Project#](https://github.com/ballercat/walt): WAlt is an alternative syntax for WebAssembly text format. It's an experiment for using JavaScript syntax to write to as 'close to the metal' as possible.

- [WebAssemblyStudio #Project#](https://github.com/wasdk/WebAssemblyStudio): Learn, Teach, Work and Play in the Web Assembly Studio.

- [v86 #Project#](https://github.com/copy/v86): v86 emulates an x86-compatible CPU and hardware. Machine code is translated to WebAssembly modules at runtime in order to achieve decent performance.

- [Zaplib #Project#](https://github.com/Zaplib): âš¡ Zaplib is an open-source library for speeding up web applications using Rust and WebAssembly.

## Server
