# Dev

## Test

- [2018-Google Test #Project#](https://github.com/google/googletest): This repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

- [2020-Catch2 #Project#](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2): A modern, C++-native, header-only, test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD - using C++11, C++14, C++17 and later (or C++03 on the Catch1.x branch)

## Debug

- [palanteer #Project#](https://github.com/dfeneyrou/palanteer): High performance visual profiler, debugger, tests enabler for C++ and Python.

# Library

- [Cello #Project#](http://libcello.org/): Cello is a library that brings higher level programming to C. By acting as a modern, powerful runtime system Cello makes many things easy that were previously impractical or awkward in C.

- [gc #Project#](https://github.com/mkirchner/gc): Simple, zero-dependency garbage collection for C.

## Framework

## Concurrent

- [ck #Project#](https://github.com/concurrencykit/ck): Concurrency primitives, safe memory reclamation mechanisms and non-blocking (including lock-free) data structures designed to aid in the research, design and implementation of high performance concurrent systems developed in C99+.
