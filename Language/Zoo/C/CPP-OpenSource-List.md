# C++ OpenSource List

- [2018-LCUI #Project#](https://github.com/lc-soft/LCUI): A small C library for building user interfaces with C, XML and CSS.

- [2018-libui #Project#](https://github.com/andlabs/libui): Simple and portable (but not inflexible) GUI library in C that uses the native GUI technologies of each platform it supports.

- [2018-libui-node #Project#](https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node): Node bindings for libui, an awesome native UI library for Unix, OSX and Windows.

# Dev

## Test

- [2018-Google Test #Project#](https://github.com/google/googletest): This repository is a merger of the formerly separate GoogleTest and GoogleMock projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

- [2020-Catch2 #Project#](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2): A modern, C++-native, header-only, test framework for unit-tests, TDD and BDD - using C++11, C++14, C++17 and later (or C++03 on the Catch1.x branch)

## Debug

- [palanteer #Project#](https://github.com/dfeneyrou/palanteer): High performance visual profiler, debugger, tests enabler for C++ and Python.

- [libtree #Project#](https://github.com/haampie/libtree): ldd as a tree with an option to bundle dependencies into a single folder

# Library

- [Cello #Project#](http://libcello.org/): Cello is a library that brings higher level programming to C. By acting as a modern, powerful runtime system Cello makes many things easy that were previously impractical or awkward in C.

- [gc #Project#](https://github.com/mkirchner/gc): Simple, zero-dependency garbage collection for C.

## Framework

- [fmt #Project#](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt): {fmt} is an open-source formatting library providing a fast and safe alternative to C stdio and C++ iostreams.

- [Abseil #Project#](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp#quickstart): The repository contains the Abseil C++ library code. Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ code (compliant to C++14) designed to augment the C++ standard library.

## Concurrent

- [ck #Project#](https://github.com/concurrencykit/ck): Concurrency primitives, safe memory reclamation mechanisms and non-blocking (including lock-free) data structures designed to aid in the research, design and implementation of high performance concurrent systems developed in C99+.
