- [2018-数据库内核杂谈 #Series#](https://www.jianshu.com/nb/25205074): 我希望能够深入浅出地去讲解数据库是一个什么样的系统，以及为什么它最后会演化成这样一个系统，为什么我们都用 SQL 来操作数据，而不是 AQL 或 BQL. 希望读者阅读后，对数据库的理解不再单单只是知道简单的 table, row 等的基本概念或者单单会写些 join, select 的 SQL 语句。而是能从源头真正做到知其所以然。

The Bibliography is presented in order of the year when the paper was published.

So let’s get started by first defining the term and the context where you might usually employ it.
