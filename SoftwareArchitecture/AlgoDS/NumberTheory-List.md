# Number Theory | 随机数 

- [2019-How to pick a random number from 1-10](https://torvaney.github.io/projects/human-rng): Imagine you have to generate a uniform random number from 1 to 10. 

# Matrix | 矩阵

- [2018-High-Performance Matrix Multiplication](https://gist.github.com/nadavrot/5b35d44e8ba3dd718e595e40184d03f0): This is a short post that explains how to write a high-performance matrix multiplication program on modern processors. In this tutorial I will use a single core of the Skylake-client CPU with AVX2, but the principles in this post also apply to other processors with different instruction sets (such as AVX512).
