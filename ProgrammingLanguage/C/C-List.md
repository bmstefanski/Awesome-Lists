- [2020-Write a Shell in C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/): University students beware! Many classes have assignments that ask you to write a shell, and some faculty are aware of this tutorial and code. If you’re a student in such a class, you shouldn’t copy (or copy then modify) this code without permission. And even then, I would advise against heavily relying on this tutorial.
