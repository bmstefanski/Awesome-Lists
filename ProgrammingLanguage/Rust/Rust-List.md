# Overview

- [2017-Deep drive into rust programming language](https://parg.co/UP1)

- [2018-Why is Rust difficult?](https://vorner.github.io/difficult.html): Rust is considered difficult to learn by many people but I don’t consider it necessarily a bad thing for a language to be hard to learn.

- [2019-想要改变世界的 Rust 语言](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/lPbag5EbuWPUZOCvObW-yw): 通过了解 Rust 遵循什么样的设计哲学，进一步了解它的语法结构和编程理念，就可以系统地掌握这门语言的核心，而不至于在其纷繁复杂的语法细节中迷失。

## Case Study

- [Why Rust is the future of robotics](https://parg.co/UVu): We believe Rust is the future of robotics because it enables developers to be fearless, to create and enforce standards, and to build and rely on a strong community.

- [2018-Rust in production at Figma](https://blog.figma.com/rust-in-production-at-figma-e10a0ec31929): How Mozilla’s new language dramatically improved our server-side performance.

- [2018-Rust in Cloudflare](https://parg.co/YA1)

## Book

- [The Rust Programming Language #Book#](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/first-edition/README.html): This book will teach you about the Rust Programming Language. Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.

- [Rust Primer #Book#](https://github.com/rustcc/RustPrimer): 中国人写的 Rust 编程书籍

- [Rust by Example #Book#](https://rustbyexample.com/): Rust by Example (RBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

- [2017-Programming Rust #Book#](https://parg.co/UPe): This practical book introduces systems programmers to Rust, the new and cutting-edge language. You’ll learn how Rust offers the rare and valuable combination of statically verified memory safety and low-level control—imagine C++, but without dangling pointers, null pointer dereferences, leaks, or buffer overruns.

- [2017-Rust Essentials-Second Edition #Book#](https://parg.co/UPI): Leverage the functional programming and concurrency features of Rust and speed up your application development.

- [2016-Algorithm Cookbook in Rust #Book#](https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms): A collection of classic data structures and algorithms, emphasizing beauty and clarity over full generality.

- [2016-Rust-101](https://www.ralfj.de/projects/rust-101/main.html): This is Rust-101, a small tutorial for the Rust language. It is intended to be an interactive, hands-on course: I believe the only way to really learn a language is to write code in it, so you should be coding during the course.

## Collection

- [Rust Books #Collection#](https://github.com/sger/RustBooks): 一系列对于 Rust 书籍的搜集。

## Series

- [2018-Writing an OS in Rust #Series#](https://os.phil-opp.com/): This blog series creates a small operating system in the Rust programming language. Each post is a small tutorial and includes all needed code, so you can follow along if you like.

# Tutorial

- [2018-Learning Rust](https://learning-rust.github.io/): Installation, Hello World, Cargo, Crates, Variable bindings, Functions, Primitive Data Types, Operators & Control Flows.

- [2018-Writing a Microservice in Rust](http://www.goldsborough.me/rust/web/tutorial/2018/01/20/17-01-11-writing_a_microservice_in_rust/): Let me begin this article on Writing a Microservice in Rust by talking about C++.

## CheatSheet
